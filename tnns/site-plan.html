        Tennis Lessons
Our tennis lessons are designed for beginners, offering a solid foundation in the fundamentals of the game. If you’ve played before and are looking to refine your skills, we recommend joining our group practice sessions. Lessons focus on key areas such as forehand and backhand drills, serving technique, and understanding the rules of tennis.
Lessons are available by appointment and can be scheduled by contacting our instructor via email. The cost is $15 per hour for a private lesson, or you can bring a friend—each additional participant is just $2 extra. Whether you prefer one-on-one coaching or a shared experience, our lessons provide personalized attention to help you improve your game.
